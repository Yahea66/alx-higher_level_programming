"""
This module defines the Base class, which is designed to manage unique identifiers (IDs) for its instances.
The IDs can either be provided by the user at the time of instantiation or automatically generated to ensure uniqueness.
The automatic generation is handled through a class-level counter that increments with each new instance without a provided ID.
